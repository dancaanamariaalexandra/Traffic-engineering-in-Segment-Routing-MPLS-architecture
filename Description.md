# Traffic-engineering-in-Segment-Routing-MPLS-architecture
In this project I demonstrated the advantages of Segment-Routing implemented over the MPLS Architecture. The first part of this project presents the main functionalities of an MPLS network which was emulated using an EVE-NG virtual machine. Some of the analysed topics were: MPLS Traffic Engineering,  Node-Protection and Link-Protection, MPLS-VPN with the key elements: VRF, RD, RT, MP-BGP. In the second part, I implemented some Segment-Routing technologies that bring a lot of benefits in a Service Provider MPLS network, such as: TI-LFA, SR-POLICY, SR-PCE.  In conclusion, I demonstrated that SR-MPLS facilitates traffic engineering, reduces  the complexity of the network significantly, guarantees agility and high fiability and also provides an easier implementation and management.
